# OTP Verification Use Cases

## UC-005: Code Verification
**As a** user,
**I want to** enter the 6-digit code sent to my phone,
**So that** I can prove my identity and complete the sign-in process.

## UC-006: Auto-Verification
**As a** user,
**I want to** have the code verified automatically as soon as I type the 6th digit,
**So that** I don't have to perform an extra click.

## UC-007: Resending Code
**As a** user who didn't receive an SMS,
**I want to** request a new verification code after a short wait,
**So that** I can try again if there was a delivery issue.
