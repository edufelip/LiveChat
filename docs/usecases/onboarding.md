# Onboarding Use Cases

## UC-001: Initial App Launch
**As a** new user,
**I want to** see a welcoming introduction to the app,
**So that** I understand the app's purpose before signing up.

## UC-002: Phone Authentication
**As a** user,
**I want to** sign in using my phone number,
**So that** I can securely access my account without remembering a password.

## UC-003: Country Selection
**As a** user from any country,
**I want to** select my country from a list,
**So that** the correct international dialing code is automatically applied to my phone number.

## UC-004: Welcome Back
**As a** returning user,
**I want to** be automatically logged in if my session is still valid,
**So that** I don't have to go through the onboarding process again.
