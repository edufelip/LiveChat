# Home Screen Use Cases

## UC-008: Tab Navigation
**As a** user,
**I want to** switch between Chats, Calls, Contacts, and Settings using a bottom bar,
**So that** I can quickly access different areas of the app.

## UC-009: Unread Notifications
**As a** user,
**I want to** see an unread message badge on the Chats tab,
**So that** I know I have new messages without opening the tab.

## UC-010: Search across Features
**As a** user,
**I want to** have a search bar at the top of each main screen,
**So that** I can find specific conversations or contacts quickly.
